    <h3 id= "about"> ABOUT US</h3>
    <p>During my time serving underrepresented communities through the Alternative Spring Break program in Howard
    University, I mananged to interact with the community and something I noticed was how the kids and youth in the
    community did not feel represented, understood and empowered. This made me wonder if there is any help I can offer
    to them.</p>
    <h4>The issue is the lack of underrepresentation, lack of understanding, and disempowerment among children and youth in underserved communities. This problem arises due to systemic factors such as limited access to resources, educational opportunities, and positive role models. When individuals do not see themselves reflected in their communities or feel understood and supported, it can lead to feelings of alienation, low self-esteem, and limited aspirations. This perpetuates a cycle of disadvantage and hampers the development of these communities. Addressing this issue is crucial for fostering inclusivity, empowerment, and social mobility among marginalized youth</h4>

      <h3> OUR STORY</h3>

Recognizing the need for positive role models and guidance, a group of dedicated individuals came together to create a program focused on mentorship and empowerment. What started as a humble initiative has now evolved into a comprehensive mentorship platform, transforming the lives of young people and shaping the future leaders of tomorrow.</p>
